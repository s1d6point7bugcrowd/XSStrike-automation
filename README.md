## Overview
This script automates the process of testing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities using XSStrike. It supports comprehensive scanning options for both single URLs and multiple endpoints extracted from a given domain.

## Capabilities
- **Automated URL Collection**: Automates the gathering of potential XSS endpoints from entire domains using `gau` and `gf`, focusing on URLs that might contain XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Custom Header Injection**: Supports the inclusion of custom headers in each request, which is crucial for bypassing specific security configurations and identifying authorized testing activities.
- **Real-Time Logging and Output Management**: Utilizes `tee` for real-time logging, allowing results to be displayed on the console and saved to log files simultaneously, which is helpful for both real-time monitoring and record-keeping.
- **Domain and Single URL Modes**: Can operate in two distinct modes:
  - **Domain-Gather Mode**: Collects and tests multiple URLs from a specified domain.
  - **Single URL Mode**: Tests a specific URL for XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Enhanced User Interface and Error Handling**: Offers an interactive mode that prompts users for input if necessary parameters are missing and provides a comprehensive help menu.
- **Parallel Testing Support**: Although XSStrike itself supports concurrent threads, the script can be further enhanced to support parallel processing at the shell level to expedite scanning across multiple URLs.
- **Structured Logging**: Maintains a structured log that separates the session overview and detailed XSS strike outputs, facilitating easier analysis and review.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- XSStrike
- `gau` and `gf` for gathering URLs

## Setup
1. Install Python and the required tools (`gau`, `gf`, and XSStrike).
2. Clone this repository or download the script.
3. Ensure the script is executable: `chmod +x xss_automation.sh`.

## Usage
Run the script with the necessary parameters. Here are some examples:

```bash
# Scan a single URL
./xss_automation.sh --url https://www.example.com --threads 3 --skip-dom

# Scan multiple URLs from a domain
